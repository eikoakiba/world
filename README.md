### Hello and welcome to my world

My indie web source code. After some years I find that there is a valuable way of interacting with the internet. And I'm sure you will get it when you decide to learn more about it :)

I don't think you would want to use the whole source code of this website lol
I'm using this repository to control my files, and probably you can use my scripts that I use to automate the compilation process.

Anyway, I hope this will gives you more motivation to create your own one.
