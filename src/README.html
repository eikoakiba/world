Hello And welcome to this page!
I always wanted to make a page feels like your using Unix hirachy As you route through pages
This pages will be simple (just HTMl) and very few CSS for better reading stuff.
Because it's not about visual effects and these pages will only be about _Content_.

There are some rules to make these pages:

1. Content should be display on any platforms, then make it as simple as possible
2. use CSS only to make the UI better for reading (just for browsers)
4. Only use _pre_ element when representing content (better for terminals)

You can read this page through terminal, just try to use curl or any terminal base
Browser that you like. (you can basically use any https client).

There will be a custome script to run this page from terminal

Always remember, I'm doing this for fun and it works.

If you have any question, just mail me: eikoakiba@proton.me
