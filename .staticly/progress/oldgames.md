Greetings internet!
Did you have the same feelings as me? Like when you was playing with your console and you said: 'Oh I wish i could play this game as a 3D game'.
When I was a kid I used to watch things that now we call old, The things that most of the people like even in 2025.
I am talking about big characters like Mario, Sonic, Megaman, etc. Those animation/games were the best thing you could have and they still are.
They had a feeling like everything is real, I used to watch sonic animation from our home's TV, It is indeed one the best feelings for me that I have
from before.


But in these years... We don't have anything interesting like before. But... Maybe we have?

Yes, there is multiple projects that want to bring back the old feelings of those things and in this blog I want to talk about those that i have
experience with.

1. Mario 64:

Mario 64 was a pivotal title in popularizing the genre and setting a new standard for 3D platformers. This is not just a game, it's a culture.
If you have ever played this game, you may know that the 3D engine of this game is so different. It feels different and acts different.
