          <p>Greetings internet!</p><p>Today I wanna talk about the freeDOS. It's an operating system that makes the old feelings open sourceI'm not really a DOS lover but I like the old aesthetic of it. Imagine you came home and now you wannaPlay some DOS based games, you look at the store and see there is 3D games, one of the them called DOOM:) and now after playing that game you want to get a C compiler and make yourself one! xd.</p><p>DOS came from old days that people wanted an operating system that can run on new chips, those homeComputers was the target of those days. Someone called <em>Tim Paterson</em>, and maybe you know the continue... yea now we have MS DOS. But on those days someone tried to write DOS from scratch and make it opensource for all the people to use. That person's name is Jim Hall. According to the internet:</p><p><em>Jim Hall started FreeDOS while an undergraduate. He wasn't a fan of Windows 3. x, and when Microsoft announced in 1994 that the next version of Windows would replace DOS entirely, Jim announced a new development effort to create an open source version of DOS. That project became FreeDOS.</em></p>
