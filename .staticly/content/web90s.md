How to make web fun again?
Today we want to turn back the old and cool internet again
2025/04/26

Greetings internet!


In this blog I wanna talk about the old good days of using internet, searching through millions of
people's websites that were cool and also simple. If you know what I'm taking about then it's not a
new topic for you, but I really like to be a part of old web community and make other people (even
not technical ones) be aware of what is going on in modern internet.


Notice: Be sure to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYlcUbLAFmw) video if you wanna completely understand what I'm taking about. (She just made a nice box of everything I wanna talk about :) )


As you may know, today social networks of people consist of some topics that they are not actually
Fun and cool. Endless scrolling feature of social medias make us robots that repeat a simple move
just to gain some more dopamine. If you search on the internet *Why endless scrolling is not good?*
You will get this:


* _Endless scrolling can dysregulate the nervous system and also appears to cause mental health symptoms like depression and anxiety._


See? With a simple search you can figure it out what is the true face behind that mask of happiness. In old days people used internet very differently, it was a tool to make us happy and more cool or maybe socialist, the goal was to make a _Second_ space *JUST* for fun!.


If you notice my words, you can see there is not any actual reason for any of those anymore, we are using internet like we live for it, we use it not for fun but for making ourself better than others, we use it mainly to make _Money_ and that money itself can change a lot of things for a environment. And you may notice that the web is not cool anymore.


If you open a website you see thousand of ads and you can't even remember they after you close the
website, you may open you social media app and DOOM scroll it for about 3 hour but you may just remember 3 of them. You can't even express your feelings because you are using a UI that only turns white and black. You can't be who you are because people will make fun of you, you ask why? Because we are living inside a world that people would show their _Best_ times and viewers are depress because they don't have that _Best_ time.


I was one of those person. A person that would doom scroll the social media because the lack of social attention. I was depress, sad, confuse, etc. I'm not saying all of those bad feelings came from modern way of treating web. I still have bad feelings when I'm alone but those modern approaches just made it worse. When I would open for example X social media, I would came across peoples _Best_ moments, the best of all, the thing that I wanted for so long. But they don't help at all, it just makes a big void inside your head and maybe you would say to yourself _I'm not good enough_.


It's just one example of what I felt and I know others have the same feelings like, that's why we are a community of people who just want the old/simple way of treating things.


Right now I barely use any social media. Maybe some will text me and I will just reply to make them happy. I'm trying to use low speed connection protocols (lmao I just made this token right now). What I mean by _low speed connection_ is that I'm trying to focus on my work and use the internet like 80s, 90s, 20s that the internet was slow and simple, it should be *_Good Enough_* unless I will not stick to it. I spend 70% of time doing things that I like and valuable. I _Love_ computers and I spend my time learn them. That's already make me a happy person by 70% at lease. When I feel bored I want to be make connection with other people, as what I said I like to use slow/creative/simple/cool social platform, like Spacehey. Guess what? I spend only 1 house *per* day for it. That means I can spend some great time and text people that I *Actually* love and make my own style for my page and don't doom scroll the entire platform.


Being creating is one another great thing that we don't have anymore, why? Because companies are so busy handling simple stuff and they can only gives you black and white themes (and people will get happy then an application adds dark mode).


Probably a modern user of internet will say: _Why do i spend so much time colorize my page? I just need some content and that's the way minimalism works_. I can say that's the way social media platforms earn more money with doing much less work than before. Algorithms are much important than creativity of people for current platforms.


I like algorithms, I'm a software engineer and most of the time I work with them, they are the basis of computer software!, But everything should have the same weight. You connote say I *just* wanna make the biggest way that people connect to each other so algorithmic, because we are human not robots.


Web is not cool anymore, but we can make it cool, there is still multiple platforms that brings old way of using web for modern users, And they are doing the _Best_. We shouldn't just think about past and say I wanna use something exactly like geocities, We need to make gecities like websites with modern power of computer engineering. A website like neocities is a great example of that. I'm running this website on neocities because it's like a portal to cool websites and people make _Just for fun_.


And it is indeed a modern website. Another example is spacehey (I said it earlier). And so on so forth.


Use old technologies, If they good enough, keep them as your primary tools. Nothing should be **Best**, it should be good enough.


That's why I'm using sway, open source, or any other minimal way of treating software. I like to make my programs in C because I can express my thoughts completely without any compile magics and make them from scratch.


I love to be creative, I love to make my _own_ scripts to automate the behavior of my computer. Not just using more programs for doing simple/complex stuff.


[I will talk about how to make web fun again and make the continue of this blog, It's already a lot things for now xD. Wait for next part.]
