*Let's talk about our favorite tool for all of the time, bash*. Bash has been always one of the primary power of using terminal over GUI, It's something that you probably use everyday if you are a Linux user. But we all know bash is hard because of its syntax but who's gonna stop us from using it? lol.

First time that I use bash in my life, I didn't know it is such a great tool for doing _literally_ everything!, it's almost like a scripting language with the power of making 1 tool that composed from multiple other tools (the real unix Philosophy). I saw the real power of bash when I tried to make a package manager with it. PDL (package downloader LainOS) is a small package manager used to install important programs during installation or post-installation of the LainOS, I will make a blog about that operating system too :D, When I started to make that project, I wanted to do it with bash because it was fun and made me learn so much about shell scripting. When project started to be usable I was thinking how great it is to just use something that seems like nobody will use for making things, for programming.

It was like a magic for me, you ask why? Because I didn't know that there is multiple package manager projects for specific operating systems, Like TS2 linux, When i saw those projects I got something very important: Maybe bash is not a great tool for making things but it is powerful enough to make the job done, one of the primary disadvantages of bash is its syntax. Bash syntax is not easy to use and you need to search on the internet each time you want to use a feature from it lol (I'm joking you will use to it). The second thing is that the debugging process of your code is *so F hard*, I mean... It's like your making something in 3PM without any source of lights xd. But it works and it's easy to run it on unix like operating systems.

One of the important part of the bash is that you use other programs and pipe the input and output to each other, that means you can combine multiple specific programs to shape another program that actually kinda like one program.

Another advantages of bash is it's not important where you run it, starts from your terminal to run it on your status bar (f.g i3bar) you can run bash everywhere you want, just imagine how creative it is to automate your whole system with just a scripting language that is open source and doesn't need any heavy dependencies and it is available even when you are in live mode of your operating system.

That's why arch guys are using bash to actually *Install* the whole system. That's why we use using it to bootstrap the build pipeline of lainOS, and that's basically the point of using it everywhere on the plant.

When you say GNU/Linux, one of the main thing/programs that came to your mind is Bash, and that's amazing. Even right now that I'm writing this blog post, after that I want to post this on the internet, I will use a bash script to automatically generate everything. The actually work is done by other programs, but bash will automate the whole process.

Remember that bash has the base structure of a programming language, you have variables, loops, arrays, maps, etc. and we even have a full web stack written in bash that you can host your website with it. :D, click [here](https://bashsta.cc/) for more information. I just wanna show you how complete the shell/bash is that you probably can do anything you want in it.

One of the great source that I have about learning bash is *Dave Eddy*, the one who has the *yousuckatprogramming* channels around the web. [here](https://www.youtube.com/@yousuckatprogramming) for its yourube and [here](https://ysap.sh/) for its site that is written completely in bash. (I just like him ^^).

It's time to change your mind and switch to a open source unix like operating system, and just use this lovely program.

I will make more contents like this in the future, see you soon and bb :> .
