Oh, look there is a blog here !
Hello, Just update of my new workspace :D
2025/04/12

Hello and welcome to this blog. My own corner of internet that I can talk as a real person. Maybe you ask why? I would say let's leave that topic for another post.

Hey! I hope you have a great day!
It's great for me, I switch to Fedora Linux after using years and years of windows 7/10. For me, GNU/Linux is life, the way you think everyday and perform your day to day work.

My switch to Fedora changed a lot of things in my workspace, For example I'm using a WM (Window Manager) that has the _minimum_ features and it's enough for someone like me.
I'm using i3wm, I used to use DWM, but I'm gonna be honest, i3 configuration is easier than DWM lol.
I really like the way DWM works, but I wanna try i3 too.
I use kitty as terminal. I know there is more minimal terminals for linux, but it does the job done and I don't need
To spend so much time configuring it! (hello beautiful kitten :D). It supports image rendering and it's important for me.

I'm using terminal most of the time, I try to do as much as I can in terminal because it's more convenient than finding button on a GUI program. I use i3bar for my system status and I wanna connect it to my coffee machine then I can see the Temperature of it ;D.

I use Neovim as my text editor, but don't counter me as a extreme user. I'm just using it because it's great for me. I like all other editors and I use them whenever I feel like it.


And finally I use _Lutris_ for playing games. And that's it!.


I tried to not be shy and contribute to open source projects. It's so so so amazing and for me it's the true programming. I would make specially post for this topic but in the nutshell, you are the person who choose what to do Be the part of what project and develop which software, It's a world full of life.

The way that I like to use my computer is to learn, use, and try all the tools that is fun. That's why I don't extreme on anything except open software, if i like to use fish instead of zsh, I would install it immediately, if i want to have a better looking environment, I would boot my machine with Gnome DE. I like to have fun in my life and I think that's the point of doing this blog too. 

I use free software as much as i can, cause software should be open and public for everyone. If you want to learn new things, the best way of doing that is to read the actual source code, and imagine there will be nothing more than a binary files. I will make separately post blog for the story of my Fedora journey.

Oh BTw, Today is so hot and I turned on my fan ^^ it feels somehow nostalgia for me.

Well, Fedora users will have a big update soon, Fedora 42! Yeaaaa... lol, we will have a lot of new stuff and specially GCC 15! A new update for that holy compiler ;d. You can check the process of on Redhat blog [here](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/04/10/6-usability-improvements-gcc-15#)

For now, seeic ecya later ;d.
